Rock, Paper, Scissors in Python
by Tammy Treit

Overview
This project will create the game Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) in Python.

The problem I am trying to solve is that I have little practical experience writing code.

Goals
Gain experience with Python and programming techniques through creating this game.

Non-Goals
I am not trying to create anything for broad consumption or monetary gain.

Milestones

Proposed Solution
Create a way for the user to select their weapon of choice
Create a way for the computer to select a weapon
Compare the two weapons
Determine if the outcome is a tie
 - if tie replay
Declare the winner
Ask to play again

Future features
 = Computer learn players tendencies
 - player chooses best x out y tries before winner is declared
 - Add windows UI
 - Add graphics
 - Animate graphics
 - 'Friends' verson with fire and water baloon - possibly make this a random event from the computer
 - Random events happen e.g "Gandalf leaps in front of the Balrog to give you another chance"
